LynkX

LynkX is a multi-chain payment platform that enables gasless transfers, CCTP v2 fast cross-chain transfers, and developer-controlled wallets (Smart Contract Accounts) powered by Circle.

We solve the complexity of payments across chains by giving business owners, liquidity providers, and treasury managers a simple Web2-style design, while keeping the Web3 flow behind the scenes.

🚀 What Are We?

LynkX is a crypto-native payment infrastructure designed to make cross-chain transactions fast, gasless, and simple.

Gasless Transfers → Users move funds between their inner wallets without worrying about gas.

CCTP v2 Fast Transfers → Instant cross-chain USDC transfers between Ethereum Sepolia, Avalanche Fuji, Base, and Polygon Mumbai (testnets).

Developer-Controlled Wallets (SCAs) → Wallets are created on Circle, with up to:

4 wallets for Merchants

8 wallets for Liquidity Providers & Treasury Managers

❓ Why LynkX?

Because today, business owners (especially in Africa) struggle to sell across chains.

Customers and merchants are often on different blockchains.

Transfers are time-consuming, complex, and expensive.

This prevents many businesses from accessing global Web3 commerce.

LynkX eliminates this friction by abstracting away blockchain complexity, so merchants and customers transact in just one click, no matter the chain.

⚙️ How LynkX Works

Connect Wallet → Users connect with MetaMask.

Authentication →

First-time users are signed up.

Returning users sign in.

A JWT token is generated for session security.

MetaMask address = unique user ID.

Wallet Creation →

First-time users automatically create wallets.

Merchants get up to 4 wallets.

Liquidity providers / treasury managers get up to 8 wallets.

Funding Wallets →

Fund directly from MetaMask to Circle wallets.

Or use Circle faucet if you don’t have USDC.

Best UX: fund via MetaMask to see CCTP v2 in action.

Payments →

Create payment links for customers (shareable for e-commerce, Shopify, eBay, personal websites).

Receive payments into Circle-controlled wallets.

Transfers →

Move funds within wallets (same chain).

Or across chains (fast, via CCTP v2).

Extras for merchants →

Add workspace → integrate with business sites.

Manage multiple wallets.
